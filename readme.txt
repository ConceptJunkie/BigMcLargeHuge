Big McLargeHuge -

What is this thing?

	"Mystery Science Theater 3000" is a show that's well known for making fun of
	(or "riffing" on) movies, especially cheaply and poorly made
	B-movies, formalizing the long tradition of what comes naturally to college
	students, blowing off classes and otherwise avoiding responsibility.

	In one particular episode (#820, "Space Mutiny"), Mike and the Bots have
	particular fun with the character of Dave Ryder, played by Reb Brown (also
	known for the 1970s TV movie version of Captain America, and an appearance
	as Chrissy Snow's boyfriend on "Three's Company").

	Anyhow, the cast offer many, rapid-fire nicknames for Reb Brown's character,
	who is a kinda big, kinda dumb, jock-type with a penchant for yelling
	strangely during action scenes.  There are dozens of these names in the
	episode, the most well-known of which is "Big McLargeHuge", but others
	include, "Slab Bulkhead", "Fridge Largemeat", "Blast Hardcheese", "Smash
	Lampjaw"... you get the idea.

Can you get to the point?

	BigMcLargeHuge.py is my attempt to generate these names programmatically,
	because you never know when you need to give a good descriptive and
	inspiring name for that big dope who's headlining your B-grade action
	movie.  I mean every year there's another effects-laden, explosion-infested,
	monosyllabic vehicle for your Bruce Willises, your Arnold Schwarzenggers,
	your Jean-Claude van Dammeseses, and someone's gotta name all these
	chunkheads.

	I've tried very hard, with the able assistance of my kids, especially
	my son Simon, who were raised on a steady diet of MST3K, "The Simpsons",
	"Monty Python", "Red Dwarf" and other subversive TV shows, to maintain the
	spirit of the jibes from Mike, Kevin, Bill and the rest of the Best Brains,
	while avoiding names that are excessively dumb or offensive.

So, there really isn't a point to this.

	Your mileage may vary.  On a more practical note, this program also
	represents a simple exercise in string manipulation and data structures in
	Python for me from back in the fall of 2012.
